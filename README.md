# Hauzisha — Real Estate Platform

## Overview

Hauzisha is a real estate platform for agents, promoters, and admins to manage property listings, track inquiries through a sales pipeline, attribute leads via tracking links, and automatically calculate commissions.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + Vite (port 8000) — `webapp/`
- **Backend**: Hono + Bun (port 3000) — `backend/`
- **Database**: SQLite via Prisma ORM — `backend/prisma/dev.db`
- **Auth**: Better Auth (email + password)

## Backend

### Database Models

| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| `User` | Accounts with roles: `ADMIN`, `AGENT`, `PROMOTER`. Includes approval status, permissions JSON, and referrer link. |
| `Listing` | Property listings. Number starts at 240226. Slug auto-generated as `{type}-for-{rent\|sale}-in-{location}-{number}`. |
| `TrackingLink` | Shareable links with a 12-char secure `refCode`. Tracks clicks and inquiries per platform. |
| `Inquiry` | Client leads linked to a listing and agent. Includes stage pipeline and full stage history. |
| `Promotion` | One record per promoter per listing they're promoting. |
| `Commission` | Auto-created when inquiry reaches `RENTED` or `PURCHASED`. Deleted if stage reverses. |
| `ClickEvent` | Records per-visitor click events (SHA-256 hashed identity) for 10-minute deduplication. |
| `Notification` | In-app notifications per user. Promoter/recruiter notifications never include client details. |
| `SystemSetting` | Key-value config: recruiter bonus, SLA hours, stale inquiry threshold. |

### Roles

- **ADMIN**: Full access to all data and settings.
- **AGENT**: Manages own listings and inquiries with full client details.
- **PROMOTER**: Sees own tracking links, promotions, and commissions — never client details.

### Listing Numbers

Numbers start at **240226** and increment. The `getNextListingNumber()` utility in `src/lib/listings.ts` queries the current max and adds 1.

### Slug Format

```
{propertyType}-for-{rent|sale}-in-{location}-{listingNumber}
```
Example: `apartment-for-rent-in-westlands-240226`

`RENTAL` → `rent`, `SALE` → `sale`. Location is lowercased with spaces replaced by hyphens.

### Tracking Link Ref Codes

Generated by `generateRefCode()` in `src/lib/listings.ts` using `crypto.getRandomValues()` — 12-char URL-safe base64, 72 bits of entropy.

### Commission Logic

Triggered in `src/lib/commissions.ts` when inquiry stage transitions to `RENTED` or `PURCHASED`:
- Agent: `price × agentCommissionPct%`
- Company: `price × companyCommissionPct%`
- Promoter (if attributed): `price × promoterCommissionPct%`
- Recruiter (if agent was referred and bonus toggle is on): flat KES amount from `SystemSetting`

If stage reverses from `RENTED`/`PURCHASED`, all commissions for that inquiry are deleted.

### System Settings (defaults)

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `recruiter_bonus_enabled` | `true` | Toggle recruiter bonus on/off |
| `recruiter_bonus_amount` | `500` | KES bonus per conversion |
| `agent_response_sla_hours` | `2` | Target first response within N hours |
| `stale_inquiry_threshold_days` | `3` | Flag inquiry as stale after N days |

### Auth

- Email + password via Better Auth
- Session middleware populates `c.get("user")` and `c.get("session")` on all routes
- Auth endpoints at `/api/auth/*`

### Admin Account

- Email: `admin@hauzisha.co.ke`
- Password: `Admin@2026`
- Role: `ADMIN`, fully approved, all permissions

Located in `webapp/`. React + Vite + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui. To be built out with the full Hauzisha UI.

### API Client

`webapp/src/lib/api.ts` — wraps `fetch` with `credentials: "include"` for cookie-based auth.

### Auth Client

`webapp/src/lib/auth-client.ts` — Better Auth React client with `useSession` hook.
